    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Agrawal was born in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India. In the 1980s, he lived in a rented house with his grandparents before moving to Mumbai.

<p>In 2001, he completed studies at Atomic Energy Central School and Junior College No.4</p>
<p>In 2005, Agrawal obtained his Bachelor of Technology degree in computer science and engineering from IIT Bombay. That year, he moved to the United States to pursue a PhD in computer science from Stanford University under the guidance of Jennifer Widom. His Stanford doctoral thesis, published in 2012, is titled "Incorporating Uncertainty in Data Management and Integration".</p>

In October 2017, Twitter announced the appointment of Agrawal as chief technology officer following the departure of Adam Massinger. In December 2019, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced that Agrawal would be in charge of Project Bluesky, an initiative to develop a decentralized social network protocol.</p>
<p>Agrawal joined Twitter as a software engineer in 2011 and became the chief technology officer in 2017.

<h2>Views and policies on online speech</h2>
<hr>
<p>In an interview with MIT Technology Review in November 2020, when asked about freedom of speech, Agrawal said: "Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation ... [and to] focus less on thinking about free speech, but thinking about how the times have changed."</p>
<p>Agrawal faced criticism from conservatives for a 2010 tweet of his which was a quotation, "If they are not gonna make a distinction between Muslims and extremists, then why should I distinguish between white people and racists." At the time, Agrawal said this was a quote from The Daily Show correspondent Aasif Mandvi.</p>
<p>A day after Agrawal's appointment as CEO, Twitter issued a new content policy stating, "Beginning today, we will not allow the sharing of private media, such as images or videos of private individuals without their consent."</p>
<h2>Personal life</h2>
<hr>
<p>Agrawal is married to Vineeta Agarwala. She is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm. They have one son, Ansh, born in November 2018.</p>
